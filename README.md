What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The main problem I addressed was creating an advising assistance program for ABCU academic advisors. The program needed to load course data efficiently, display all available courses in alphanumeric order and allow users to retrieve information on specific courses, including prerequisites. This required building a robust data management system to handle course data and support quick lookups.


How did you approach the problem? Why are data structures important to understand?

I approached the problem by focusing on data organization and retrieval efficiency. Based on my analysis from Project One, I decided to use a hash table for this task, as it supports fast data access, which is ideal for applications requiring frequent searches. Understanding data structures is essential in software development because they directly impact a program's efficiency, speed, and scalability. By selecting a hash table, I could ensure that course lookups and data manipulation operations were optimized for the user's needs.


How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered?

I encountered roadblocks, such as managing user input validation and file errors. To overcome these, I implemented error handling for file operations and designed a user input validation function to ensure smooth interaction with the menu. Testing was also crucial in identifying and fixing unexpected behaviors, such as handling empty files or malformed data entries, improving the programâ€™s reliability.


How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This project reinforced the importance of planning and analyzing the problem before coding. By developing pseudocode and analyzing various data structures, I understood the optimal solution and could code with a purpose. This approach helped me focus on building a scalable and efficient program while keeping the user experience in mind, which is essential in real-world applications.


How has your work on this project evolved regarding how you write maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs?

Working on this project highlighted the need for clear code structure and documentation. To enhance readability, I used in-line comments, meaningful variable names, and modular functions. Additionally, I focused on keeping the code adaptable for potential future requirements, such as adding new features. The experience has improved my approach to writing maintainable code, ensuring that others (and my future self) can easily understand and expand upon my work.
